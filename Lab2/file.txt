Implement a program that reads in a text file, counts how many times each word occurs in the file and outputs the 
words (and counts) in the increasing order of occurrence, i.e. the counts need to be output in sorted order: rare words 
first. Word is any sequence of alphanumeric characters separateed by whitespace or punctuation marks.
Whitespace and punctuation marks are to be discarded. That is, the punctuation marks should not 
be counted either as a part of the word or as a separate word. You are free to make your program 
case sensitive (Hello and hello are counted as separate words) or case insensitive. File name is supplied on 
command line. You are to use the following classes.
