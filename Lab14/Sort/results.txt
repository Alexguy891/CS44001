Ran sort algorithms on 50,000 random elements
Results:
standard sort ran for 0.0135823 seconds
bubble sort ran for 35.1387 seconds
insert sort ran for 15.1507 seconds

Standard sort has time complexity of O(nlog(n))
Bubble sort has time complexity of O(n^2)
Insert sort has time complexity of O(n^2)

Standard sort clearly has a faster time complexity, thus the much faster result.
Bubble and insert sort have similar time complexities, however bubble tends to be slower due to lots of swapping.
